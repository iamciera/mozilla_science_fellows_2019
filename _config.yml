  position: Neuroscientist
  text: I <a href="https://alexmorley.me/Back-Your-Scientific-Stack/">support</a> the development of software that is built around the needs of humans. I have been working with neuroscientists to build <a href="https://users.flatironinstitute.org/~magland/docs/"> an open platform </a> for automatically benchmarking analysis algorithms, with data scientists to write <a href="https://www.turing.ac.uk/research/research-projects/turing-way-handbook-reproducible-data-science"> a handbook for reproducible data science </a>and designers to build a graphical interface for computational notebooks.

  position: Evolutionary Biologist
  text: One of the main missions of my work is to make scientific research and data more open and transparent. I do this by <a href="http://ropensci.github.io/reproducibility-guide/"> establishing best practices </a>, data standards, and <a href = "https://reproducible-science-curriculum.github.io/organization-RR-Jupyter/">creating education materials</a>.  This year I have been working on making natural history data more usable, accessible, and valued. Visit <a href = "https://curiositydata.org"> curiositydata.org </a> for more information on this project.

  position: Neuroscientist
  text: I am interested in pushing open science by building low-cost but high-performance scientific equipment based on <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.3000014"> Open Source Hardware</a>. Together with different groups and labs we are building a <a href="https://fosh-following-demand.github.io/en/home"> global understanding of current research-tool needs </a> that are not met by competitive open hardware alternatives.
